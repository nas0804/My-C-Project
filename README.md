# My-C-Project
In this repository is a simple Menu System with differnet features I developed in my first year at university using C#.

The menu feature uses simple validation to ensure that the user can only input specific values to select the next system they wish to move on to.

The next feature is a "water bill calculator" which takes numerical inputs from the user and uses pre-set calculations to determine the cost of the bill.

The next feature is a "Library Catalogue" which uses object orientated programming to create books with the following attributes: Type (Fiction or Non-Fiction), Genre, Title and Author, and then store them in a list of objects. The user can then view the books from the list to see what is in the Library.

The final feature is a hexadecimal converting feature, which converts denary integers into hexadecimal strings.

All features of this project use validation to ensure the user can only input desired values ensuring no errors can occur in the system.
